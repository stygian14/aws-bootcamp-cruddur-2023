# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
Chapter 1: https://www.youtube.com/live/SG8blanhAOg?si=2m-bKkUDKWubbVkm
Here, I went through the format of the bootcamp and the business usecase of the project. Apart from this, I also went through the architectural diagram of what we plan to build and how to use Lucid Charts to build architectures. Also got intoduced to various models like C4 models. This video also talked about how to build a good architecture by gathering your RRAC's - Requirements, Risks, Assumptions and Contraints. Once the RRAC's have been gathered, you can create a Conceptual design, Logicalm design and then a Physical design. 

Here is the Conceptional design for Cruddur app: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/0d05c807-c57f-40a6-919e-94e41262a5b7/edit?viewport_loc=-1118%2C-414%2C2220%2C946%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_72456583-0124-449d-a7b8-49f92c6cf5ef
